PyBank: Analysis on monthly Profit/Loss data PyPoll: Analysis on election result

#PyBank
In this challenge, I have created a Python Script to analyze the financial records of your company. The resource file has the budget data month wise, number of Profit/Losses

Created a script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Analysis Output :

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
In addition, the final script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

#PyPoll
In this challenge, I have created a Python Script to analyze the election results of a Poll. The resource file has the poll data that contains Columns Voter ID, County and Candidate

The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

A complete list of candidates who received votes
