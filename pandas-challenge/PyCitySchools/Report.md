## PyCitySchools Challenge - Analysis

* The spending_summary DataFrame shows that the passing rate is not directly proportional to the Amount spent on that school per Student. The overall passing rate is more for the schools that spent lower budget compared to the ones that spent high amount.

* The data shows that has smaller student count has more passing rate than schools with higher student count. 

Also Charter schools has significantly higher passing rate than the District School Types, But more analysis is required if the number of students in Charter Schools compared to the students in District School has any effect on this trend.
